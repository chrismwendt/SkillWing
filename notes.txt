TODO
    make timestamps consistent (either seconds or milliseconds)
    make itemStream async with a callback
    setup root domain to point to skillwing.herokuapp.com
    consider players gain xp in discrete steps, might not land on level
    consider Bitcoin for payments
    consider passport or "Log in with X" for user authorization
    consider tracking stats over time
    consider crowd sourcing training methods
        adding, deleting, and modifying training methods
            supplies are added with name, rate, and cost to obtain
                cost to obtain can vary depending on skills and gear, so it could be based on samples
        players submit their xp/h rates for training methods
            maybe gain reputation by recording values close to others
            example training method sample list:
                at [Fletching 23, Crafting 38], Yew shortbow gives [Fletching 8400] xp/h
                at [Fletching 24, Crafting 38], Yew shortbow gives [Fletching 8400] xp/h
                at [Fletching 24, Crafting 38] with Fletcher gloves, Yew shortbow gives [Fletching 9200] xp/h

Problems
    people don't train efficiently because they lack some know-how and time, or they use a bad source
        know-how to compare training methods
            it's not hard to do simple comparisons, but most players don't know how
            efficiency can get complicated with recursion
        time to acquire data and perform the comparisons
            best case now: spreadsheet which fetches prices which is a one time cost
            more probable worse case: look up methods and type in prices by hand
        other sources can be outdated by prices and lack context, but generally good (RS Wiki, YouTube)
    current skill calculators are aren't very useful
        they only say the # of widgets you need to make, not which type is most efficient
        it gives the same results for everyone, even though time value varies between players
        summoning planner is decent, but still doesn't factor in prices or time, nor does it attempt to maximize XP
    tracking your stats is tedious
        by hand or screenshots takes time and doesn't format the data
        rstracker does not update automatically

Method comparison formulas
    adjusted gp/xp = gp/xp - mm/h / xp/h           -> linear
    adjusted xp/h  = xp/h * (mm/h / (mm/h - gp/h)) -> intuitive, asymptotic
